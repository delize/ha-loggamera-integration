# Security Policy

## Workflow Security

This repository uses automated GitHub Actions workflows with built-in security controls:

### üîí Permission Levels

| Workflow | Required Permission | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Auto-Fix Code** | Write or PR Author | Can format code on PRs you created or if you're a collaborator |
| **Release Creation** | Admin/Maintain | Only repository admins can create releases |
| **Version Bumping** | Automatic | Triggered only by merged PRs with proper labels |
| **Validation** | None | Runs on all PRs for safety |

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls

1. **Permission Checks**: All manual workflows verify user permissions before running
2. **Rate Limiting**: Auto-fix workflow limited to 5 runs per user per hour  
3. **PR Validation**: Users can only auto-fix their own PRs or PRs from the main repo
4. **Audit Logging**: All manual workflow runs are logged with user and timestamp
5. **Fork Protection**: Special handling for PRs from forks

### üö® Abuse Prevention

- **No anonymous access**: All workflows require GitHub authentication
- **Collaborator-only**: Manual workflows restricted to repository collaborators
- **Admin-only releases**: Only admins/maintainers can create releases
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents workflow spam
- **Audit trail**: All actions are logged and traceable

### üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in our workflows or code:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email the repository maintainers directly
3. Include details about the vulnerability and potential impact
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### üîß Workflow Security Best Practices

For contributors:
- Only run auto-fix workflows on your own PRs
- Don't share workflow URLs with unauthorized users
- Report suspicious workflow activity
- Use proper branch protection in your forks

For maintainers:
- Regularly review workflow run logs
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- Keep workflows updated with latest security practices
- Review and approve all workflow changes
